The first arm has circles of sizes ['small', 'medium', '?'], the second arm has circles of sizes ['small', 'medium', 'large'], and the third arm has circles of sizes ['small', 'medium', 'large']. We observe that the circles in each arm progress in size from small to medium to large. Thus, the pattern is that the circles in each arm get bigger as they progress away from the center of the spiral. Based on the pattern that the circles in each arm get bigger as they progress away from the center of the spiral, the size of the missing part that is farthest from center should be B."}
