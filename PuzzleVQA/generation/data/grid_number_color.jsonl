The first row has number-color pair [(9, 'red'), (7, 'purple'), (9, 'red')], the second row is [(3, '?'), (3, 'green'), (7, 'purple')], and the third and final row is [(1, 'orange'), (1, 'orange'), (3, 'green')]. We observe that the grid cells with number 7 is purple in color, the grid cells with number 9 is red in color, the grid cells with number 1 is orange in color, and the grid cells with number 3 is green in color. Thus, the pattern is that the grid cell with the same number will have the same color. Based on the pattern that the grid cell with the same number will have the same color, the missing color of the part with 3 should be C."}
