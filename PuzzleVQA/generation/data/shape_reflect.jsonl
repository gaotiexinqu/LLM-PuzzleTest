{"image": "images/shape_reflect/shape_reflect_0001.png", "question": "What figure is represented by the question mark?", "options": ["triangle", "square", "hexagon", "pentagon"], "answer": "There are six shapes in the image separated by a line. In the top part there are ['pentagon', 'hexagon', 'triangle']. In the bottom part there are ['pentagon', '?', 'triangle']. We observe that the hexagon is reflected across the line as a hexagon. Similarly, the pentagon is reflected as a pentagon. Hence, the pattern is that each shape in the top part is reflected in the bottom part. Based on the pattern that each shape in the top part is reflected in the bottom part, the missing shape which is reflected from a hexagon part should be C."}
