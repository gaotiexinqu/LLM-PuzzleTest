{"image": "images/shape_size_grid/shape_size_grid_0000.png", "question": "What size belongs in the place of the question mark?", "options": ["medium", "large", "small"], "answer": "There are 9 shapes arranged in a grid with different sizes in the image, of which there is 1 missing shape. The first row is ['small hexagon', 'medium hexagon', 'large hexagon'], the second row is ['small pentagon', 'medium pentagon', 'large pentagon'], and the third row is ['small triangle', 'medium triangle', '?']. We observe that the columns contain small shapes, medium shapes, and large shapes respectively. On the other hand, the rows contain hexagons, pentagons, and triangles respectively. Hence, the pattern is that the shapes within each row are the same, while each column progresses the size of the shapes. Based on the pattern that the shapes within each row are the same, while each column progresses the size of the shapes, the size of the missing triangle should be B."}
