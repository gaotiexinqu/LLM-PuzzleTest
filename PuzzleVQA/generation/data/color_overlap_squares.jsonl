The color of the squares are ['?', 'blue', 'yellow']. The part where the first and second squares overlap is purple. The part where the second and third squares overlap is green. We observe that the blue and yellow squares overlap to form green. Hence, the pattern is that the color of the part where two squares overlap is determined by mixing the two colors. Based on the pattern that the color of the part where two squares overlap is determined by mixing the two colors, the missing color of the part which overlaps with blue to form purple should be C."}
