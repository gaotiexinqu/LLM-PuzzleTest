The numbers from left to right are [2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, '?']. The lengths from left to right are ['medium', 'short', 'long', 'medium', 'long', 'short', 'medium']. We observe that the short rectangles are denoted as 1, the medium rectangles are denoted as 2, and the long rectangles are denoted as 3. Hence, the pattern is that the number in each rectangle corresponds to its length. Based on the pattern that the number in each rectangle corresponds to its length, the missing number of the rectangle with a question mark should be B."}
