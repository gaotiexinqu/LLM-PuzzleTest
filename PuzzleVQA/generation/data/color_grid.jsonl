{"image": "images/color_grid/color_grid_0000.png", "question": "What is the missing color where the question mark is?", "options": ["blue", "orange", "purple", "green"], "answer": "There are circles with different colors arranged with a grid formation in the image. The colors in the first row are ['red', 'orange', 'red'], the colors in the second row are ['orange', 'blue', 'orange'], and the colors in the third row are ['red', '?', 'red']. We observe that the circles at the corners are red, while the circles directly adjacent to the center are orange. Only the center circle is blue. Hence, the pattern is that the circles alternate in color depending on if they are at the corner or adjacent to the center. Based on the pattern that the circles alternate in color depending on if they are at the corner or adjacent to the center, the missing color of the part that is adjacent to the center should be C."}
