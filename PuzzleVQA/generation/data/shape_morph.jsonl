The top left shape is a square and the bottom right shape is a ?. The other shapes do not appear to regular shapes. We observe that from the top left to bottom right direction, the shapes look like a square but gradually change shape into something like a triangle. Hence, the pattern is the the shapes are morphing between square and triangle shapes. Based on the pattern that the shapes are morphing between square and triangle shapes, the missing shape at the bottom right should be a A."}
