The first group is [4, 5, '?'], the second group is [3, 1, 3], and the third group is [9, 7, 63]. We observe that the number 3 is the product of 1 and 3. Similarly, the number 63 is the product of 7 and 9. Hence, the pattern is that the rightmost number in each group is the product of the other two numbers. Based on the pattern that the rightmost number in each group is the product of the other two numbers, the missing number of the group [4, 5, '?'] should be D."}
