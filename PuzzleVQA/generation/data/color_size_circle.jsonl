The circles are ['medium', 'large', 'small', 'extra large'] size, and their colors are ['medium red', 'dark red', '?', 'very dark red']. We observe that the largest circle is very dark red color, and the smaller circles change color from dark red to medium red. Hence, the pattern is that the circles become lighter as they become smaller. Based on the pattern that the circles become lighter as they become smaller, the missing color of the smallest circle denoted with a question mark should be B."}
