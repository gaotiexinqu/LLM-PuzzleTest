The parts are denoted with the numbers [3, 1, '?', 1, 7, 9] respectively. We observe that the numbers in the orange parts add up to 10. Similarly, the numbers in the purple parts also add up to 10. Thus, the pattern is that the numbers in the parts of the same color add up to 10. Based on the pattern that the numbers in the parts of the same color add up to 10, the missing number of the red part should be B."}
