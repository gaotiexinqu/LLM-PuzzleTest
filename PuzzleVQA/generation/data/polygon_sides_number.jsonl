We observe that the polygon with 9 sides has the number 9, the polygon with 6 sides has the number 6, the polygon with 8 sides has the number 8, the polygon with 4 sides has the number 4, and the polygon with 5 sides has the number 5. Thus, the pattern is that the number inside the polygon represents the number of sides the polygon has. Based on the pattern that the number inside the polygon represents the number of sides of the polygon, the missing number of the polygon with 3 sides should be A."}
