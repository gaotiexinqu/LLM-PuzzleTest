The lengths from left to right are ['long', 'short', 'medium', 'long', 'medium', 'short', 'long']. The colors from left to right are ['purple', 'blue', 'yellow', 'purple', 'yellow', 'blue', '?']. We observe that the blue rectangles are of short length and the yellow rectangles are of medium length. Hence, the pattern is that the color of each rectangle corresponds to its length. Based on the pattern that the color of each rectangle corresponds to its length, the missing color of the part denoted with a question mark should be B."}
