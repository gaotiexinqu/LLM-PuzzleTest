{"image": "images/shape_size_hexagon/shape_size_hexagon_0000.png", "question": "Can you identify the size of the missing shape denoted by a question mark if it is a pentagon?", "options": ["small", "large", "medium"], "answer": "There are 7 shapes with different sizes in the image, of which there is a missing pentagon in the center. The other shapes are arranged around the center, which are ['triangle', 'pentagon', 'hexagon', 'triangle', 'pentagon', 'hexagon'] in anti-clockwise order. Their corresponding sizes are ['medium', 'small', 'large', 'medium', 'small', 'large']. We observe that the triangles are medium size, the pentagons are small size, and the hexagons are large size. Hence, the pattern is that each shape appears with a distinct size. Based on the pattern that each shape appears with a distinct size, the size of the missing pentagon should be A."}
