{"image": "images/color_hexagon/color_hexagon_0001.png", "question": "What color is represented by the question mark?", "options": ["A orange", "B purple", "C blue", "D yellow"], "answer": "There is a hexagon split into six parts with the colors ['green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'green', '?', 'yellow'] in an anti-clockwise order. We observe that a green part is opposite another green part, and a yellow part is opposite another yellow part. Thus, the pattern is that the colors in opposite parts are the same. Based on the pattern that spatially opposite parts have the same color, the missing color of the part which is opposite a blue part should be blue."}
