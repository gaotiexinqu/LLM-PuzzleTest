The sizes in the first row are ['medium', 'large', 'medium'], the sizes in the second row are ['large', 'small', 'large'], and the sizes in the third row are ['medium', '?', 'medium']. We observe that the circles at the corners are medium size, while the circles directly adjacent to the center are large size. Only the center circle is small size. Hence, the pattern is that the circles alternate in size depending on if they are at the corner or adjacent to the center. Based on the pattern that the circles alternate in size depending on if they are at the corner or adjacent to the center, the size of the missing part that is adjacent to the center should be B."}
